# ScottCheck: SBV-based verification of Scott Adams adventure games

This program takes old Scott Adams text adventure games, and checks
that they can be solved by executing them symbolically and feeding it
to an SMT solver.

See https://gergo.erdi.hu/blog/2020-08-01-solving_text_adventure_games_via_symbolic_execution/
where I write about the why and the how.
